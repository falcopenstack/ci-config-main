#
# Modify the three values above based on the following:

#  Q. What do you want to use the CI for?
# A1. Just testing internally: set the project name to openstack-dev/ci-sandbox.
#     This is a testing ground for the CI. You can submit dummy patches to this
#     project to trigger the CI.
# A2. Officially testing cinder patches: set the project name to openstack/cinder.
#     The CI will be in production mode and will run test jobs for every patch
#     submitted to the official cinder project.

#  Q. What do you want to do with the results?
# A1. Just email the results internally: set the pipeline to silent.
#     This is useful if you want to run jobs without posting the results to Gerrit.
# A2. Post the results to Gerrit: set the pipeline to check.
#     When the job finishes, the results will be posted to Gerrit and the link to 
#     the logs will be included. This is required when the CI is in production mode.

#  Q. Is our driver code officially merged into the openstack/cinder repo?
# A1. Yes: Set the job name to dsvm-<proj>-fss-iscsi. Replace <proj> with either
#     ci-sandbox or cinder. It should match the second part of the project name.
# A2. No: Set the job name to dsvm-<proj>-fss-iscsi-custom. Replace <proj> with
#     either ci-sandbox or cinder. It should match the second part of the project name.
#     The '-custom' suffix at the end of the job name indicates that the job will 
#     separately download our driver code from our private repo. Once our driver is 
#     merged into the upstream repo, we no longer need to do this, and the '-custom' 
#     suffix can be removed.
